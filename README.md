## **📌 Project Overview**  

The goal of this project is to develop an **efficient food classification system** capable of distinguishing between different food categories. The following tasks were performed:  

✅ **Binary Classification:** Pizza 🍕 vs. Steak 🥩  
✅ **10-Class Classification:** Classifying images into 10 different food categories  
✅ **101-Class Classification:** Classifying images from the full **Food101 dataset**  
✅ **Transfer Learning:** Using **EfficientNet & ResNet** with **Feature Extraction & Fine-Tuning**  
✅ **Training on 10% vs. 100% of Data:** Evaluating model performance on limited vs. full dataset  
✅ **Data Augmentation:** Improving generalization using transformations like flipping, rotation, and zoom

## **📊 Results & Insights**
- EfficientNetB4 (Fine-Tuned) performed best for 101-class classification on 100% of the data.
- Feature extraction works well on small datasets, but fine-tuning improves performance on large datasets.
- Data augmentation helped improve model generalization, reducing overfitting.

## **📌 Future Improvements**
🔹 Experiment with Swin Transformers for food classification.

🔹 Optimize training using learning rate schedules.

🔹 Deploy model as a web application for real-time classification.
